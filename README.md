This was made for shuffling Bridge deals, without having to actually shuffle the deck.  Just take any deck and lay the cards according to the arrows.

With some practice you can deal a deck just as fast as mechanically possible, without having to shuffle.

Truly randomizing a deck by shuffling requires 6-7 typical "riffle shuffles", which takes at least half a minute and is quite tiring.  Many people do not do this, and you end up with badly shuffled deals in your tournament.

This little helper avoids this situation.
